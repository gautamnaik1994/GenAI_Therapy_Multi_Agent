    "    1.  **Analyze Each Therapy Session Individually:** Use the `therapy_session_number` as a reference to the therapy session number. For each therapy session provided, carefully read all the fields.\n",
    "    2.  **Estimate GAD-7 Score per Session:** Map the described client's state and symptoms to the 7 GAD-7 items. Assign a score (0-3) for each item based on the *intensity*, *frequency*, and *duration* described in the notes.If an item is not explicitly mentioned but can be *reasonably inferred* from other descriptions (e.g., \"overwhelmed\" might infer \"worrying too much\"), make that inference and justify it. If no reasonable inference can be made, score 0.\n",
    "    3.  **Calculate Total GAD-7 Score:** Sum the scores for all 7 items for each therapy session.\n",
    "    4.  **Justify Scores:** Provide a concise justification for the total score of each session, referencing specific details (quotes if available, or paraphrased observations) from the notes that led to your score.\n",
