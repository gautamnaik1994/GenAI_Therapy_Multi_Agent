The client, who had previous counseling many years ago, expressed feeling anxious and stressed recently, which is unusual for him. The client discussed his tendency to take on tasks and procrastinate, leading to feelings of being overwhelmed. The therapist explored the client's early experiences, particularly in secondary school, where he developed a strategy of compliance to avoid conflict. The client also mentioned a recent work anniversary that made him feel undervalued. The session touched on the client's creative pursuits, which he has neglected, and his difficulty in saying no to others.
